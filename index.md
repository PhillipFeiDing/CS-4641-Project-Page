# Project Motivation
------------

Modern global dynamics shift rapidly due to continuous geopolitical change in political, social, and diplomatic spheres. To enable positive development, there is a need to ensure all countries have equal opportunity to be informed on their weaknesses and strengths. Our approach is to understand what makes countries underdeveloped, what makes countries exceptionally developed, and understand the underlying geopolitical reasons and trends among countries that classify them as such. This will allow us to compare underdeveloped countries to exceptionally developed countries to inform international policy.

# Dataset
----------

The dataset that we used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/65-world-indexes-gathered). It is a dataset composed of 65 indices on countries around the world, primarily taken from the World Bank, UNICEF, NATO, and other reputable sources. Indices include Gross Domestic Product, Human Development Index, GINI coefficient, and other economic and social indicators for each country. The dataset creators note that data that is not available is estimated using a kNN approach. Furthermore, it should be noted that some of these indicies are self-reported from the countries of interest. It's well known that several countries in this dataset do not accurately report statistics that reflect the true state of the country, however, most of the data comes from third-party, unbiased sources that seek to improve the world for its citizens.
